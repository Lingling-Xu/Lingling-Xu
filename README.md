## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Lingling-Xu/Lingling-Xu** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on immune response to virus infection
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cytometry in R: https://umgcccfcsr.github.io/CytometryInR/
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Flow cytometry and NGS data analysis
- Previous Coding Experience: Repeatedly Calling IT
- What I Hope to Get From This Course: A faster way to match FlowSOM clusters to their likely cell type.
